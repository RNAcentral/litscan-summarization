    <h1 class="text-center">LitSumm</h1>
    <p class="text-start">Please assess the quality of the RNA summaries generated by LitSumm. These summaries have been created by taking sentences from LitScan and passing them through chatGPT to create what should be helpful summaries that give you a general idea what the literature says about a given RNA
    </p>
    <p>This site stores some cookies in your browser. These keep track of which RNA IDs you have seen, and give you a unique ID so I can differentiate reviews when analysing the data. The ID is random and should be completely anonymous. If you want to reset the list of IDs you've seen, click the button below.</p>
    <p>To start reviewing, click start below. Doing so will take you to a page where the RNA ID is at the top, followed by the chatGPT generated summary. You should see something that looks like this:</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Screen1.png')}}" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 50%">
    <p>By clicking the "Not Good" or "Good!" button, your feedback will be recorded in the database, and a new ID will be loaded</p>
    <h4>Additional Feedback</h4>
    <p>You might like to provide additional feedback to narrow down what went wrong. To do this, click the "Additional Feedback" dropdown, and a set of checkboxes will appear: </p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Screen2.png')}}" class='img-thumbnail' style="max-width: 50%">
    <p>These checkboxes should be fairly self explanatory. One thing to note - the absence of a checkmark is recorded as false in the database, so e.g. leaving the "contains contradictions" checkbox blank means that the text is not contradictory.</p>
    <h4>Seeing the Context and Prompt</h4>
    <p>It may be helpful to look at the context from which the summary was generated, for example if you think a hallucination has gotten into the summary. Equally, you may be interested to see what the prompt looked like (they are the same for all summaries). To see these bits of text, click the relevant dropdown and they will appear.</p>
    <h4>Having no opinion</h4>
    <p>If you don't want to express an opinion on a summary for any reason, just refresh the page and another one will load for you.</p>
